Using nodejs tools within Visual Studio to load project source:

You can load Angular1View within Visual studio, though you will first have to install
nodejs tools from http://nodejstools.codeplex.com/

Before running the project from visual studio right-click on "npm" special folder and click
"Update NPM packages menu"
This will install express and other node packages. After that, you can CTRL + F5 to run the express server.

The URL in this case could be different on your workstation, e.g.
http://localhost:1337/app
